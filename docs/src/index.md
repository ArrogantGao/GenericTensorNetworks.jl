# GraphTensorNetworks

This package uses generic tensor network to compute properties of combinatorial problems defined on graph.
The properties includes the size of the maximum/minimum set size, the number of sets of a given size and the enumeration of configurations of a given set size.

## Background knowledge

Please check our paper ["Computing properties of independent sets by generic programming tensor networks"]().
If you find our paper or software useful in your work, we would be grateful if you could cite our work. The [CITATION.bib](https://github.com/Happy-Diode/GraphTensorNetworks.jl/blob/master/CITATION.bib) file in the root of this repository lists the relevant papers.

## Quick start

You can find a good installation guide and a quick start in our [README](https://github.com/Happy-Diode/GraphTensorNetworks.jl).

A good example to start with is the [Independent set problem](@ref).
