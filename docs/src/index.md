# GraphTensorNetworks

This package uses generic tensor network to compute properties of combinatorial problems defined on graph.
The properties includes the size of the maximum set size, the number of sets of a given size and the enumeration of configurations of a given set size.

## Background knowledge

Please check our paper ["Computing properties of independent sets by generic programming tensor networks"]().

## Quick start

You can find a good installation guide and a quick start in our [README](https://github.com/Happy-Diode/GraphTensorNetworks.jl).

A good example to start with is the [Independent set problem](@ref).
