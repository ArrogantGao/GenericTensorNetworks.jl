# ### Set packing problem
# It is a generalization of the independent set problem from simple graph to hypergraph.

# ### Vertex cover problem
# In graph theory, a vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of every edge of the graph.
# Let ``G=(V,E)`` be a graph, a set of vertices ``X \subset V`` is independent if and only if its complement ``V \backslash X`` is a vertex cover.
# Hence the problem of finding vertex covers of size ``k`` is equivalent to finding independent sets of size ``|V|-k``.

# ### Maximal clique problem
# The maximal clique of graph ``G`` is a maximal clique of ``G``'s complement graph.
