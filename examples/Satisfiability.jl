# # Satisfiability problem

# !!! note
#     This tutorial only covers the maximal independent set problem specific features,
#     It is recommended to read the [Independent set problem](@ref) tutorial too to know more about
#     * how to optimize the tensor network contraction order,
#     * what are the other graph properties computable,
#     * how to select correct method to compute graph properties,
#     * how to compute weighted graphs and handle open vertices.
